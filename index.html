                There are thousands of satellites currently in orbit, with many satellites passing in the sky overhead at any given moment.
                You can receive some of them yourself with a cheap <span class="hint">SDR<span class="hint-popup"><b>S</b>oftware <b>D</b>efined <b>R</b>adio</span></span> and antenna, and with weather satellites, you can receive beautiful images of the Earth as seen from space taken by satellites in orbit, decoded in near real time.

                        These satellites pass overhead multiple times a day, but you will get more passes
                         the closer you get to the Earth's poles. These are the easiest satellites to receive as you can
                          get something in your result even if the signal is really weak. The currently 
                          active satellites are <time>NOAA 15, NOAA 18, and NOAA 19</time>. Each of their 
                          signals are analogue, so if you listen to the demodulated signal, you can hear 
                          the distinct "ticks" and "beeps" of the satellite easily.
